# Describe how Magento determines which controller to use and how to customize route-to-controller resolution

Within 'Mage/Core/Controller/Varien/Router/Standard.php', for example, our path information is analysed and a string representing the appropriate module name is extracted.

If you remember, our path information is split and put into an array. The first value of that array is the module name. 

How is this string value, e.g. 'catalog', able to let Magento load the appropriate module and the appropriate controller?

Magento attempts to match our string value against '<frontName>' tags in the config to find a '<routers>' node.

Magento will loop over the list of resultant candidate modules (often a list of one, such as array('Mage_Catalog')) with a foreach loop.

In the array representing our path information, the second value is the controller name. Magento will call a method to check our candidate modules for our desired controller class file. 

When we find the correct class we instantiate a controller object.

## Customization
Magento will check the 'core_url_rewrite' database table to try to find a match for the route or alternatively a router may be added
during the events fired. Magento then references the configuration XML to find a match for the route.
