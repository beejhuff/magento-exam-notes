Belvg have created an excellent image which covers the whole chapter - [https://belvg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DjZEo.jpg](https://belvg.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DjZEo.jpg)



# 1. index.php

It is highly recommended to check out index.php or Belvg's explanation above. Only a brief overview for revision purposes is supplied here :-
index.php does the following :-

1. Checks PHP Requirements (PHP version cannot be older than 5.2.0)
2. Checks for Compiler and includes compiler classes
3. Include the file 'app/Mage.php'. If the file cannot be found then...
4. Checks for downloader directory and checks for app/Mage.php inside of here
5. Checks for maintenance.flag, if it exists then exit to show maintenance page
6. Check if Magento is set to developer mode or not
7. Checks for server run_code and run_type
8. Runs Mage::run($mageRunCode, $mageRunType);

This is a brief overview and a couple of other small checks are done within this file but this is the outline of the important tasks index.php does.


### 1.1. Notes on MAGE_RUN_CODE and MAGE_RUN_TYPE

**MAGE_RUN_TYPE**

By default this is "store" if there is no server MAGE_RUN_TYPE set

- store (store view)
- website (website)
- group (store)


**MAGE_RUN_CODE**

This is the code e.g. base or german and the value is associated to which store/group/website you need to load.

**Examples:**

1. German website

    SetEnv MAGE_RUN_TYPE "website"
    SetEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE "german"


2. German Store View/Store

    SetEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE "german"


**Note:** These are used further along in the initialization process at *Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initCurrentStore($scopeCode, $scopeType)*


# 2. Mage::run($code, $store);

**Note:** Before we begin looking at this, please note that at the top of the file the autoloader and include paths have been [set](https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/1.%20Basics/1.%20Architecture/6.%20Explain%20class%20naming%20conventions%20and%20their%20relationship%20with%20the%20autoloader.md).

Unlike index.php, app/Mage.php is a hulking file with a whole bunch of Magento method definitions contains within. 

When 'app/Mage.php' is first called, a few actions defined at the top of 'app/Mage.php' execute. Magento will check if compilation mode is enabled.
If the compiler is not enabled then Magento will include default paths, load code pools, load app/code/core/Mage/function.php (assuming it hasn't been overwritten), load lib/Varien/Autoload.php and call Varien_Autload::register() method.

Also of interest to this question if the 'run()' method which is called in the last link of 'index.php'. Once again, let's bullet point some of the main actions of this function:

Overview

1. Checks for options (3rd parameter)
2. Calls app class Mage_Core_Model_App
3. Sets the application as installed
4. Sets the config model Mage_Core_Model_Config with the array of options
5. Calls apps run - Mage_Core_Model_App->run(array $options);

# 3. Mage_Core_Model_App->run(array $options);

It is within this method where most of the Magento initialization work is done. Belvg describes it as 'the heart of the application initialization process'.
Here is an overview of what happens in this method :-

1. Loads local.xml and config.xml in baseInit(), which in turn loads 'Mage::getConfig'.
2. Checks if request is cached and sets response
3. Otherwise it loads the modules in \_initModules(); and also runs resource update/install scripts
4. Loads Area (frontend/admin/install)
5. Sets the current store from parameters
6. Runs Data script update (different to resource update scripts)
7. Calls the front controller

That is the spine of the Magento application initialization process, but we can explore some of the methods called in 'Mage_Core_Model_App->run' in a little bit more depth.

## 3.1. Mage_Core_Model_App->baseInit($options)

1. Sets the error handler
2. Initiates the config
3. Sets the options in the config class
4. Loads the config.xml and local.xml into Config Class -  Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadBase()
5. Initiates caching

    ### 3.1.1 Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadBase()

    This merges the XML from under app/etc into the config class.
    So basically config.xml and local.xml would be merged in the config class.

    So it does the following:

    - Loads the XML files under app/etc e.g. config.xml and local.xml using *glob*
    - Loops through these files
    - Clones Mage_Core_Model_Config_Base
    - Adds xml from the file to this class
    - Merges Mage_Core_Model_Config_Base into Mage_Core_Model_Config

## 3.2. Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initModules();

So in Mage_Core_Model_App->run() we check if the request is cached and return the cache if it exists.

Otherwise we call this method and this does the following if the modules are not already cached:

- Load Modules
- Merges config data from Database
- Runs Resource Install/Update scripts
- Processes and configuration values in the config.xml
- Saves Cache

    ### 3.2.1. Loading modules

    Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadModules();

    - Loads modules under app/etc/modules using glob
    - Loads modules it depends on
    - Merges config.xml into config node of class Mage_Core_Model_Config
    - **Important:** Merges back in local.xml file afterwards to prevent overrides

    Then it runs setup updates by checking version numbers of the modules against the database table core_resource.

    ### 3.2.2 Merges Config data from database

    Mage_Core_Model_App::loadDb()

    ### 3.2.3 Runs Resource Install/Update scripts
    
    Mage_Core_Model_Resource_Setup::applyAllUpdates();
    
    Its important to note the name of the class and method for the exam and that this runs before the data scripts.
    Data updates are called in the applyAllDataUpdates() method of the class.


## 3.3. Mage_Core_Model_App->\_initCurrentStore($scopeCode, $scopeType);

As mentioned earlier these parameters are set at the end of the index.php and are passed through to Mage::run();

## 3.4. $this->getFrontController()->dispatch();
Dispatches the Front Controller - more information [here](https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/2.%20Request%20Flow/2.%20Front%20Controller/2.%20Describe%20the%20role%20of%20the%20front%20controller.md)

# Important Notes

**Merging Config.xml**

Magento loads config.xml and local.xml and adds them to the config class.
It loads the modules config.xml and merges them into the config class.
It then loads the local.xml file and re-merges it into the config class to prevent overrides by modules.\

**Scripts:**
Resource Scripts are called before Data Scripts and also when the config merges the database config.
