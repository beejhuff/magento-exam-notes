# Describe URL structure/processing in Magento

The URL structure usually follows the following format:
{base_url}/{front_name}/{controller}/{action}

'Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Standard' parses the URLs in this format and maps them to a module used and the controller action to be executed.
