#  Describe the steps needed to create and register a new module

**Note:** This really just gives an overview of how modules are loaded but covers how to create and register a module.

**Important:** app/etc/local.xml is loaded at the start of the process and is merged back in after the modules are loaded to prevent the local.xml values from be overriden.

# Overview of Request Process for Modules

1. index.php
2. Mage::run()
3. Mage_Core_Model_App->run() (which eventually loads the config.xml and local.xml files first into Mage_Core_Model_Config)
4. Mage_Core_Model_App->_initModules()
5. Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadModules()
6. Mage_Core_Model_Config->_loadDeclaredModules();
7. Mage_Core_Model_Config->loadModulesConfiguration();
8. Merge back in app/etc/local.xml


# 1. Get Module XML Files -

So in the method _loadDeclaredModules() it does the following:

Mage_Core_Model_Config->_getDeclaredModuleFiles() returns an array of all XML files found under app/etc/modules.

**Note** These are ordered by Mage_All, Mage files and then any other file when returning the array.

Example of a module XML file is

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <config>
        <modules>
            <Colin_Request>
                <codePool>local</codePool>
                <active>true</active>
                <depends>
                  <Mage_Core />
                </depends>
            </Colin_Request>
        </modules>
    </config>


# 2. Sort Modules

So in the same method the XML is added in a new instance of Mage_Core_Model_Config_Base() class and then some checks to see if the module is active and exists.

Then the method *_sortModuleDepends* is called and sorts the modules with the <depends> node into an order for the Mage_Core_Model_Config_Base()

# 3. Appended to Mage_Core_Model_Config

Then the Mage_Core_Model_Config_Base() class of all sorted modules is extended onto the node "modules" for the Mage_Core_Model_Config class.

# 4. Load Module config.xml

So in the method *loadModulesConfiguration()* this loads in the config.xml files of the modules.

So in a config.xml file you would have the following:


    <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <config>
        <modules>
            <Colin_Request>
                <version>0.0.1</version>
            </Colin_Request>
        </modules>

# 5. Merge local.xml

After this method is complete, the loadModules() method then gets the app/etc/local.xml file and extends it from the class so none of the local.xml is overridden (e.g. database details)
