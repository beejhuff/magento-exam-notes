# Describe Magento templates and layout files location

## 1. Design Areas

When you go to app/design you have following 3 design areas:

- install
- frontend
- adminhtml


## 2. Templates

Templates files will be found under *app/design/{{area}}/{{package}}/{{theme}}/template* directory e.g. app/design/frontend/rwd/default/template/ would contain all RWD theme frontend template files.


## 3. Layout

Layout files will be found under *app/design/{{area}}/{{package}}/{{theme}}/layout* directory.
This would generally only contain your local.xml for your theme or your theme XML files.


### 3.1 Child Themes

If your theme is a child theme you would have a theme.xml file found under *app/design/{{area}}/{{package}}/{{theme}}/etc/theme.xml*

For example if it was a child theme of the RWD theme, we would add the following to our theme.xml file:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <theme>
        <parent>rwd/default</parent>
    </theme>
