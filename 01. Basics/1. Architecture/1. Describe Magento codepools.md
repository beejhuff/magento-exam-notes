# Describe Magento codepools

## 1. Overview

There are 3 codepools under the app/code directory:

- local
- community
- core


## 2. Autoloading

In *app/Mage.php* these 3 paths are loaded using *set_include_path* using a trick
of imploding the array of paths with a double colon and passing it as the parameter for this function.

**Note:** the *lib* directory is also added the at the end of the array of paths. The *lib* directory contains core libraries for Magento such as the Zend Framework.

This will include the 3 codepool paths instead of 1. When the autoloader is searching for a file it will look in these 3 sub-directories for the file in order listed above.

If you wanted to add your own codepool you would add a path to *$paths* array.

The autoloader class is *Varien_Autoload* and can be found in the *lib/Varien* directory.
