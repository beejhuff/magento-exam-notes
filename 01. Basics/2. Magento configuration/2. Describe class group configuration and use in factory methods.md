# Describe class group configuration and use in factory methods 


## Overview

**Note:** Please note this was covered in the wiki [Explain how Magento loads and manipulates configuration information](https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/1.%20Basics/2.%20Configuration/1.Explain%20how%20Magento%20loads%20and%20manipulates%20configuration%20information.md)

Below is a list of Factory methods used to get a class in Magento.

      $helper                 = Mage::helper( 'core' );
      $model                  = Mage::getModel( 'sales/order' );
      $resourceModel          = Mage::getResourceModel( 'catalog/product' );
      $modelSingleton         = Mage::getSingleton( "sales/order" );
      $resourceModelSingleton = Mage::getResourceSingleton( 'catalog/product' );



## 1. Notes on some Factory Methods


#### Helper - $helper - Mage::helper('core');

If there is no forward slash, "/data" is appended to the string.
So in the example above it would load *Mage_Core_Helper_Data*


#### Resource Model - Mage::getResourceModel('catalog/product');


When registering a resource model your config.xml would like the following:

      <models>
          <catalog>
              <class>Mage_Catalog_Model</class>
              <resourceModel>catalog_resource</resourceModel>
          </catalog>
          <catalog_resource>
              <class>Mage_Catalog_Model_Resource</class>


There is 2 important parts to note, the *resourceModel* node and the class node in *catalog resource*.

So this method replaces the group name (catalog) with the resource model node name (catalog_resource) before calling the method *getModelInstance* which resolves the class name.

This is changed in the method *_getResourceModelFactoryClassName*.


#### Singleton = Mage::getSingleton("sales/order");

This is the same as Mage::getModel() but the only difference is that the class when loaded is added to the registry using the Singleton Pattern. This stops the class from be loaded twice.


The model is saved to the static *$registry* property in the class *Mage*.

      $registryKey = '_singleton/'.$modelClass;
      if (!self::registry($registryKey)) {
          self::register($registryKey, self::getModel($modelClass, $arguments));
      }
      return self::registry($registryKey);
