# Register an Observer

## 1. Create an observer

You create an observer using the factory method *Mage::dispatchEvent($name, array $data = array())*

In the example below we are going to double the final price.
Magento core code regular dispatches events, often with an array of parameters, that can be 'listened' to and acted upon by observers. We can tinker with
the final price of a product by listening for the below event.


    Mage::dispatchEvent('catalog_product_get_final_price', array('product' => $product, 'qty' => $qty));

## 2. Call Observer in your Module

So in our module's config.xml under the global -> events node we would add the following.

    <global>
        <events>
            <catalog_product_get_final_price>
                <observers>
                    <colin_duplicate_price>
                        <type>singleton</type>
                        <class>Colin_Bootstrap_Model_Observer_Price</class>
                        <method>duplicateFinalPrice</method>
                    </colin_duplicate_price>
                </observers>
            </catalog_product_get_final_price>
        </events>

As you can see *catalog_product_get_final_price* is the name of the observer event that we are listening for.
Within the <catalog_product_get_final_price> node we simply define the type, class and method that we would like to be called when this event is picked up.

Then in an observer class (in the Model directory of your module) you would add the following:

    class Colin_Bootstrap_Model_Observer_Price extends Mage_Core_Model_Abstract
    {

    	/**
    	 * Duplicates the final Price
    	 *
    	 * @param Varien_Event_Observer $observer
    	 */
    	public function duplicateFinalPrice($observer)
    	{
    		$price = $observer->getEvent()->getProduct()->getFinalPrice();
    		$price = $price * 2;
    		$observer->getEvent()->getProduct()->setFinalPrice($price);
    	}

    }

Please note that parameter product is called using $observer->getEvent()->getProduct(). The observer object itself can be accessed and any other parameters that were dispatched in the 'dispatcheEvent' method can be accessed.
Similarly if we wanted to get the quantity it would be $observer->getEvent()->getQty().
