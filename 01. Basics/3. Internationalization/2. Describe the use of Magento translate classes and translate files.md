# Describe the use of Magento translate classes and translate files

## 1. Overview

A better and more in depth explanation can be found here at

## 2. Types of Translations

There are 3 types of translations:

1. Theme Translations
2. Module Translations
3. Database Translations


### 2.1. Theme Translations

These are translations which are found in the "translate.csv" file in the theme under the locale folder

**Example**

If we were translating our store for German the translate file would be found under the following:

    app/design/{{package}}/{{theme}}/locale/de_DE/translate.csv

And a example of translating a string is

    "Recently Viewed Products", "KÃ¼rzlich angesehene Produkte"

### 2.2 Module Translations

These are module translations which are found under the app/locale/{{locale_code}} directory.

**Example**

This is how we would translate the search string for the German store

File would be under:

    app/locale/de_DE/Mage_Core.csv


String would be:

    "Search entire store here...", "Suchen Sie hier ganzen Laden ..."


### 2.3 Database Translations


This is translations made on the website when you turn on the inline translation editor under System -> Configuration -> Developer -> Translate Inline.

These values are stored in the core_translate table.


## 3. Priority

The priority of translating strings are as follows:

1. Database Translations
2. Theme Translations
3. Module Translations



## 4. How Translations work in Magento

The __() in Mage_Core_Model_Abstract gets the arguments and calls *Mage_Core_Model_Translate->translate($args)*

When the *Mage_Core_Model_Translate* class is loaded it does the following in the *init* method

- Checks for cache and if so sets the _data property with the cache
Otherwise it

- Loads the modules translation files and adds the translations to _addData()
- Loads the theme translation files and adds the translations to _addData()
- Loads the database translations and adds the translations to _addData()

The _addData() method adds the string to an property _data which is called to get a string translation

However if Developer Mode is set it, Magento doesn't use translations unrelated to module.
