Magento is made up of websites, stores and store views. Here is an example of a typical Magento setup.

    Website A ----- Store A
                |
                |__ Store B _______ Store View A
                               |
                               |___ Store View B


In this setup, each store view can be associated with a seperate language. Store View A, for example, might be the 'English' store view. Store View B might be the 'French' store view.
Each of these store views can be assigned a different locale in System->Configuration->General->Locale Options.
After selecting a locale, you need to ensure you have the corresponding  Magento translation packages.

Also, the currency for the store can be selected at System->Configuration->Currency Set Up.

**Customers**

Customers are per website basis so if you were migrating to Magento and had 2 different set of customers you would have to setup multiple stores.
