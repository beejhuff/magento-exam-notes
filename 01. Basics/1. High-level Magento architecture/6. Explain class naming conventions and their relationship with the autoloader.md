# Explain class naming conventions and their relationship with the autoloader

## 1. Sets the include paths

The autoloader class is *Varien_Autoload* and can be found in the *lib/Varien* directory.

There are 4 include paths loaded with the *set_include_path* function in *app/Mage.php*:

1. app/code/local
2. app/code/community
3. app/code/core
4. lib

**Note:** The *lib* directory contains core libraries for Magento such as the Zend Framework.

Also, the *lib/Varien/Autoload.php* file is included once so the class *Varien_Autoload* can be called.

When the autoloader is searching for a file it will look in these sub-directories for the file in the order listed above. If you wanted to add your own codepool you would add a path to *$paths* array.

## 2. Autoloader

Once all of these include paths have been added inside of *app/Mage.php* and once *Varien_Autoload* has been included in *app/Mage.php* then
the 'register()' function of *Varien_Autoload* is called, which in turn calls another function: *spl_autoload_register*.

This method then does the following:

1. Replaces any underscore with a space
2. Uppercases the filename using *ucwords*
3. Replaces the space with the *DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR*
4. Appends .php to the end of the file

So for instance the class *Mage_Catalog_Model_Product* filename would autoload the file  *Mage/Catalog/Model/Product.php*.

PHP would search in the 3 codepools (and lib, if it gets that far) for this file. In this example, the Autoloader would find the file under *app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Product.php*.
