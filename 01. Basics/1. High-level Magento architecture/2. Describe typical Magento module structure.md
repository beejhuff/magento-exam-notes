# Describe typical Magento module structure

## 1. Overview

Inside of app/code/local, for example, you can create a namespace. A namespace can be, for example, a 
company name.
In the path app/code/local/acme/test, 'acme' is the namespace and 'test' is the module name.

A module directory typically has the following directories:

- Block (responsible for rendering content)
- controllers (responsible for processing all requests made via a URL)
- etc (contains XML module configuration files)
- Helper (This folder can be filled with other useful module code; functions used by the function for example)
- Model (Contains objects of data and provide data management function)
- sql (Houses scripts for setuping up or upgrading the database based on the module's needs)

Outside of this file structure, a module registration file is required inside of app/etc/modules
and a module may also have external resources such as CSS or JavaScript, located within the skin folder, or templates and XML layout files located
inside the app/design directory.
