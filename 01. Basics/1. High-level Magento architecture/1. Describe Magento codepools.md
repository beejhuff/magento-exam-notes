# Describe Magento codepools

## 1. Overview

There are 3 codepools under the app/code directory:

- local
- community
- core

The core directory contains Magento core sourcecode and should never be editted. The community codepool is often utilised by 
third-party module developers. The local codepool can be used to develop your own code.
