# Describe the shipping rates calculation process:

In **Mage_Sales_Model_Quote_Address** Mage_Shipping_Model_Shipping->collectRates() is called.

    $result = Mage::getModel('shipping/shipping')->collectRates($request)->getResult();

This then gets all the carriers and checks their credentials (country etc) and calls collectRates($request) for each valid carrier.


# Questions
## How does Magento calculate shipping rates?

1. Firstly it gets all carriers under default -> carriers.
2. It then validates and calls the collectRates method which returns a Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Result object with rates in the
Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Result_Method class.

## What is the hierarchy of shipping information in Magento?

Rates are stored in sales_flat_quote_shipping_rate

## How does the TableRate shipping method work?

This allows for a CSV to be uploaded and imported into **shipping_tablerate** table.

This contains:

1. website_id
2. dest_country_id
3. dest_region_id
4. dest_zip
5. condition_name
6. condition_value
7. price
8. cost

It can have the following conditions:

1. Price vs Destination - code: price
2. Weight vs Destination - code: weight
3. Items vs Destination - code: qty


## How do US shipping methods (FedEX, UPS, USPS) work?

These methods use the abstract class Mage_Usa_Model_Shipping_Carrier_Abstract to collect the rate.
They are usually made through 3rd party services via HTTP or SOAP requests.
