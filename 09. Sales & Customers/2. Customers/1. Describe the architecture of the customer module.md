# Describe the architecture of the customer module

There are 4 main sections for a customer:

1. Address
2. Customer
3. Customer Group
4. Attribute

Customers have 2 entities:

1. customer
2. customer_address


# 1. Customer

## Tables

**customer_entity**

This stores the following:

1. entity_id
2. customer_id
3. attribute_set_id
4. website_id
5. email
6. group
7. increment_id
8. store_id
9. created_at
10. updated_at
11. is_active
12. disable_auto_group_change

It also has the following tables to store attributes like any normal EAV system.

1. customer_entity_datetime
2. customer_entity_decimal
3. customer_entity_int
4. customer_entity_text
5. customer_entity_varchar

## Classes

- Mage_Customer_Model_Customer
- Mage_Customer_Model_Resource_Customer
- Mage_Customer_Model_Resource_Customer_Collection


## Configuration Options

Under Customers -> Customer Configuration here are some options to be aware of:

1. Account Sharing (per website/global)
2. Group Assignment based on address (disabled by default)
3. Welcome emails
4. Show middle name, prefix, date of birth, tax/vat, gender
5. Redirect customer to dashboard on login
6. Address templates
7. Enable Captcha

# 2. Customer Address

## Tables

**customer_address_entity**

1. entity_id
2. entity_type_id
3. attribute_set_id
4. increment_id
5. parent_id (customer_entity id)
6. created_at
7. updated_at
8. is_active

We then have the following normal tables in EAV:

1. customer_address_entity_datetime
2. customer_address_entity_decimal
3. customer_address_entity_int
4. customer_address_entity_text
5. customer_address_entity_varchar

## Classes

- Mage_Customer_Model_Address
- Mage_Customer_Model_Resource_Address
- Mage_Customer_Model_Resource_Address_Collection

## Billing vs Shipping

This is saved in the quote model in **Mage_Sales_Model_Quote_Address->getAddressType**


# 3. Other Tables

**customer_form_attribute**

This contains form code and attribute id for each form for Customers. These are used for forms and also to copy over values when creating a quote (see next notes.)

e.g

| form_code     | attribute_id     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| adminhtml_customer       | 17       |
