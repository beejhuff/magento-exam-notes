# Describe cancel operations:

Magento orders can be cancelled until all items have been invoice, e.g. during the pending or processing state. This automatically cancels payment and order items (which just set cancelled tax amounts on the item). Invoices can be cancelled, returning order totals to pre-invoice state. Same goes for credit memos. Only shipments cannot be cancelled.
