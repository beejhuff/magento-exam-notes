# Describe the similarities and differences between adminhtml and frontend interface and routing:

Both the main (frontend) and admin routers are registered under global -> web -> routers


    <web>
        <routers>
            <admin>
                <area>admin</area>
                <class>Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Admin</class>
            </admin>
            <standard>
                <area>frontend</area>
                <class>Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Router_Standard</class>
            </standard>
        </routers>


However if we wanted to register a router the different is the **<use>** parameter and also the **area** e.g. frontend or admin.


**Frontend**

    <frontend>
      <routers>
          <catalog>
              <use>standard</use>
              <args>
                  <module>Mage_Catalog</module>
                  <frontName>catalog</frontName>
              </args>
          </catalog>
      </routers>

**Admin**

    <admin>
        <routers>
            <colin_adminhtml>
                <use>admin</use>
                <args>
                    <module>Colin_Adminhtml</module>
                    <frontName>slider</frontName>
                </args>
            </colin_adminhtml>
        </routers>
    </admin>


We also need to set a menu and ACL for the user to access this (more later on).

Also frontend router extends from *Mage_Core_Controller_Front_Action* and admin router extends from **Mage_Adminhtml_Controller_Action**


# Questions

## Which areas in configuration are only loaded for the admin area?

All routers under **admin**

## What is the difference between admin and frontend controllers?

- Frontend extends **Mage_Core_Controller_Front_Action**
- Admin Extends **Mage_Adminhtml_Controller_Action**

## When does Magento figure out which area to use on the current page?

In **Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Front->dispatch()** it figures it out by going through the 4 controllers.

See [https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/2.%20Request%20Flow/4.%20Request%20Routing/1.Describe%20request%20routing(request)%20flow%20in%20Magento.md#L1](https://github.com/colinmurphy/magento-exam-notes/blob/master/2.%20Request%20Flow/4.%20Request%20Routing/1.Describe%20request%20routing(request)%20flow%20in%20Magento.md#L1) for more details.

## How you can make your controller work under the /admin route

Register a router under admin (See above).
