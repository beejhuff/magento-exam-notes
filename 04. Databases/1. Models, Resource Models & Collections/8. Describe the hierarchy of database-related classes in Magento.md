# Describe the hierarchy of database-related classes in Magento

Paraphrasing http://excellencemagentoblog.com/question/describe-the-hierarchy-of-database-related-classes-in-magento/:


Most flat models in MAgento extend from 'Mage_Core_Model_Resource_Db_Abstract'.

This class contains all basic CRUD methods for load(), save(), delete(), getTable(), getConnection() and many other important functions. This class extends 'Mage_Core_Model_Resource_Abstract'.

Another important class is 'Mage_Core_Model_Resource_Db_Collection_Abstract' which is the class extended by all resource collections. This class is further extended by 'Varien_Data_Collection_Db' and it extends 'Varien_Data_Collection'.
